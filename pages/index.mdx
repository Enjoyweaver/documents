Uberrimae Fidei means "of the utmost good will" and we wanted to build an insurance product around that idea. 
and within insurance, the best example of that is captive style insurance, so that is why we created Uberrimae Fidei, the Bitcoin Captive Insurer. 

### What is Bitcoin Captive Insurance?

Bitcoin has become a valuable asset for both individuals and institutions and as more people invest
in Bitcoin, it's crucial to find effective ways to insure these digital assets. That's where
Bitcoin Captive Insurance (BCI) comes into playâ€”a unique insurance model that provides coverage
for your Bitcoin holdings while giving you back all underwriting profit.

### Traditional Insurance vs. Bitcoin Captive Insurance

In traditional insurance, roughly 50% of your premiums are set aside in an interest-earning pool
to cover any future potential claims. And during the course of your policy, any claims you have
will come out of this pool, but when your insurance policy expires, any remaining funds in there
will go to the insurance company as profit.
However, a captive insurance model allows for individuals to own the insurance the company, write an 
insurance policy for themselves, and then to retain any and all underwriting profit. There are many 
hurdles to creating a captive insurance model and not everyone will even qualify, but those that do 
will benefit from insuring their bitcoin, owning part of an insurance company, and receiving underwriting 
profits.

### Benefits of Bitcoin Captive Insurance
- Potential for Profit: With BCI, you and the other owners can potentially earn profits, especially if there are no losses. It's like having a smart investment plan for your Bitcoin.
- Tax Advantages: BCI comes with tax benefits. You can write off the money you put into the insurance as a business expense, leading to potential tax savings.
- Effective Risk Management: BCI helps you manage the risk of holding Bitcoin. If any issues arise, the insurance pool can help cover the costs, reducing potential financial burdens.
- Enhanced Security Measures: As owners of the insurance company, you have a vested interest in improving security measures to protect your valuable Bitcoin holdings.
- A single comprehensive insurance policy: coverage can be tailored to you as captive members will benefit from having a single policy that offers comprehensive coverage including all known attack vectors  Coverage areas include:
    - Idle Asset Coverage: insures against such loss of assets where no previous approval was recorded on the blockchain
    - Transaction Coverage: insures against the loss of assets during the course of a transaction
    - DeFi Coverage: insures against the loss of funds that are deployed in the defi stack
